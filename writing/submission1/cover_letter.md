To the Editors:

We are pleased to submit the manuscript "Temporal changes in the individual size distribution decouple long-term trends in abundance, biomass, and energy use of North American breeding bird communities" for consideration as a Research Article in _Global Ecology and Biogeography_. One of the core imperatives for modern biodiversity science is to understand how, and why, the structure and function of ecological communities are changing. In particular, changes in the functional composition of a community - such as changes in the community-level size structure - can decouple the long-term dynamics of different currencies of ecological function - such as total abundance as measured in individuals, or total standing biomass or metabolic flux. Working from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we used allometric scaling and species' traits to generate the first continent-wide compilation of timeseries of community size structure and total community biomass and energy use for terrestrial animals. We found that, while long-term trends in individual abundance were dominated by declines, trends in total biomass were evenly divided between increases and decreases. This reflects a consistent shift in the community-level size structure favoring larger-bodied species. We believe that this work will be of great interest to the biodiversity studies and macroecology communities, and hope that it inspires further work investigating the drivers and consequences of changes in the size structure from local to global scales. 

Thank you very much for your time and consideration,
